# CodeOps Studio

Welcome to **CodeOps Studio** is a free and open-source code editing workspace and Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed specifically for Android OS.

> [!NOTE]\
> Development of CodeOps Studio is currently slow until i get a PC :( that's to say your pull requests to the `main branch` containing Kotlin, Python, C, C++ code would be rejected for now.\
> Otherwise consider the `dev branch` (A fun place for experiments).\
> CodeOps Studio is **NOT** intended for piracy and other non-legal uses. It could be used for localizing and adding features, adding support for custom platforms, and other GOOD purposes. Just try to be fair with the authors of an app, that you use and probably like.

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> CodeOps Studio main focus is on Android OS. Using it one other operating systems maybe impossible unless emulated, there is no guarantee that it'll work perfectly without errors.\
> Minimum Android API level is `API level 26 (Android 8)`.\
> Support for screens > 600dp is still experimental :)
